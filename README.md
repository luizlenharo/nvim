# Nvim Configs

Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository! This repository contains my personal configurations and plugins for Nvim.

## Prerequisites

Before you start installing these configurations, ensure you have the following:

- **Neovim** installed on your system. You can download it from the [official website](https://neovim.io/) or via package managers like `apt`, `brew`, or `pacman`.
- **Git** for cloning this repository.
- **Curl/Wget** for downloading additional resources, if needed.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the configurations from scratch:

### Step 1: Install Neovim

You can download it from the [official website](https://neovim.io/) or via package managers like `apt`, `brew`, or `pacman`
```bash

```
### Step 2: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luizlenharo/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
